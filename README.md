used to do small tasks

Several small scripts I often find myself wishing I had, now I do!

1. make_loss_area_tcd_mosaics

To run: python make_loss_area_tcd_mosacs -g "U:/user/yourfolder/geodatabase name.gdb"
This will put 4 mosaics into that geodatabase: Hansen 2014 loss, area, tcd from 2000 and emissions tiles (even though mosaic name is biomass)
